        <h3>It's a garlic spaghetti recipe that I believe I've had before. Regardless. it looks delicious.</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. </li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
            <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined. </li>
            <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </li>
        </ol>
